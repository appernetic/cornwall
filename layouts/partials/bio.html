title: about Häusle
---
Häusle in Cornwall is the title of a book written by Elisabeth Kabatek and means 'little house' in German.
We decided to call our Cornish cottage in Redruth, just a few miles from where the story takes place, Häusle to market it as a holiday destination for our German holidaymakers. Please follow our blog on twitter, instagram or RSS!
