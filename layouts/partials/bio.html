H채usle in Cornwall is the title of a book written by Elisabeth Kabatek and means 'little house' in German.
We decided to call our Cornish cottage in Redruth, just a few miles from where the story takes place, H채usle to market it as a holiday destination for our German holidaymakers. Please follow our blog on twitter, instagram or RSS!
